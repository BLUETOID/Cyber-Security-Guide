            <h2>1.1 Cybercrime: Definition and Origins</h2>
            
            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Definition of Cybercrime</strong>
                <p>Cybercrime refers to criminal activities carried out using computers, networks, or the internet as the primary tool or target. It encompasses any illegal activity that involves a computer system or network, including unauthorized access, data theft, fraud, and disruption of services.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Origin of the Term</h3>
            <p>The term "cybercrime" emerged in the late 20th century with the proliferation of computer networks and the internet. The prefix "cyber" derives from "cybernetics," coined by Norbert Wiener in 1948, referring to the science of communication and control systems. As computers became interconnected, criminal activities adapted to exploit these new digital environments.</p>

            <h3>Information Security</h3>
            <p>Information Security (InfoSec) is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h4>The CIA Triad</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. This is typically achieved through encryption, access controls, and authentication mechanisms. For example, using passwords, biometric authentication, or encrypting sensitive files to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle. This involves preventing unauthorized modification or deletion of information. Techniques include checksums, digital signatures, and version control systems to detect and prevent tampering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that authorized users have reliable access to information when needed. This requires protection against system failures, network outages, and denial-of-service attacks. Methods include redundancy, backup systems, disaster recovery plans, and load balancing.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Additional Security Concepts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. Common methods include passwords, biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition), smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) which combines two or more authentication methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Determines what actions or resources an authenticated user is permitted to access. This is implemented through access control lists (ACLs), role-based access control (RBAC), or attribute-based access control (ABAC).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of converting plain text into cipher text using mathematical algorithms to protect data confidentiality. Encryption can be symmetric (same key for encryption and decryption, e.g., AES) or asymmetric (public-private key pairs, e.g., RSA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or network that can be exploited by attackers. Vulnerabilities can exist due to software bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords, or outdated systems. Organizations use vulnerability scanners and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>1.6 Cyber Offenses: How Criminals Plan Attacks</h2>

            <h3>Attack Planning Methodology</h3>
            <p>Cybercriminals typically follow a systematic approach when planning and executing attacks:</p>

            <h4>1. Reconnaissance</h4>
            <p>The initial phase involves gathering information about the target. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passive Reconnaissance:</strong> Collecting publicly available information without direct interaction</li>
                <li><strong>Active Reconnaissance:</strong> Directly probing target systems for vulnerabilities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Scanning and Enumeration</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Port scanning to identify open services</li>
                <li>Vulnerability scanning to find exploitable weaknesses</li>
                <li>Network mapping to understand the target infrastructure</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Gaining Access</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploiting identified vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Using social engineering techniques</li>
                <li>Deploying malware or other attack tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Maintaining Access</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Installing backdoors for persistent access</li>
                <li>Creating rogue accounts</li>
                <li>Modifying system configurations</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Covering Tracks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Deleting or modifying log files</li>
                <li>Using anonymization techniques</li>
                <li>Removing evidence of intrusion</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>1.10 Botnets: The Fuel for Cybercrime</h2>

            <div class="definition">
                <strong>Definition:</strong>
                A botnet is a network of compromised computers (bots or zombies) controlled remotely by an attacker (botmaster) through a command and control (C&C) server. These networks are used to carry out large-scale malicious activities.
            </div>

            <h3>Botnet Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bot (Zombie):</strong> An infected computer that executes commands from the botmaster. The user is typically unaware their device is compromised and part of a botnet. The bot software runs in the background, awaiting instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Botmaster (Bot Herder):</strong> The attacker who controls the botnet and issues commands to the bots. The botmaster can rent out the botnet to other criminals or use it for their own malicious purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Command and Control (C&C) Server:</strong> The infrastructure used to send commands to bots and receive data from them. C&C can use various protocols including IRC (Internet Relay Chat), HTTP/HTTPS, P2P (Peer-to-Peer), or domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to evade detection. Modern botnets use encrypted communication channels to avoid interception.</li>
